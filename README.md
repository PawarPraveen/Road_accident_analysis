# 🚗 Accident Severity Analysis using Machine Learning 🚗  

This project aims to analyze and predict accident severity based on various factors like vehicle type, road conditions, weather, and more.  

📌 **Project Description:**  
- **Dataset:** Contains accident-related information, including vehicle details, road alignment, light conditions, and accident causes.  
- **Goal:** Predict accident severity using machine learning models.  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.  

🔍 **Project Workflow:**  
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing  
2️⃣ Feature Engineering  
3️⃣ Data Visualization  
4️⃣ Model Building (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)  
5️⃣ Model Evaluation  
6️⃣ Prediction for New Data  

📊 **Results:**  
- Insights on accident severity based on key factors.  
- Evaluation of different models for the best prediction accuracy.
